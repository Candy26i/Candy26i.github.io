## UCLA, Researcher on VLM's Latent and Induced Persona
**Advisor:** Dr. Yizhou Zhao; Prof. Yingnian Wu  
**Dates:** [Specify your dates here]

- Designed benchmark approaches utilizing social media platforms’ datasets to investigate different VLMs’ latent personas.
- Created pipelines that automatically extract screenshots of shorts, information from social media, and responses from VLMs, then store and manage the database using back-end SQL and AWS S3.
- Converted image data into a vectorized database utilizing Milvus, aiding in searching for VLM’s interests.
- Developed strategies for inducing VLMs' personas and evaluating their performance in comprehending the given personas, leveraging social media’s recommendation systems.
- Evaluated multiple popular VLMs, including LLaVA-1.6, Gemini-Provision, and GPT-4V, and simulated an automated process for playing social media shorts.
- Authored a research paper detailing the project, constructed the pipeline graph using draw.io, and illustrated the research.
